# DRD4 Software Working Group

I am convener of the Software Working Group of the DRD4 Collaboration, which is a new international collaboration focused on the development of next-generation Photon Detectors and Particle Identification Techniques.

## AI for RICH Reconstruction

I am interested in the development of AI-based algorithms for the reconstruction of RICH detectors. In particular, I am working on the development of a new algorithm for the reconstruction of the Cherenkov rings in RICH detectors based on deep learning techniques. The purpose of this algorithm is to provide a fast and efficient reconstruction of the Cherenkov rings, which can be used for particle identification in high-energy physics experiments.
