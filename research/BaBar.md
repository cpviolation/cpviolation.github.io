# BaBar

During my doctoral studies, I was a member of the BaBar collaboration, an experiment based at SLAC, Stanford, USA. My research focused on the search for CP violation in multibody decays of charm mesons. I initially studied the decay $$ D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^- $$ [1], followed by the $$ D^+ \to K^+K_S^0\pi^+\pi^- $$ and $$ D_s^+ \to K^+K_S^0\pi^+\pi^- $$ decays [2]. I was responsible for all aspects of these analyses and developed the triple-product asymmetry technique, which—after several refinements—I continue to apply within the LHCb experiment. During this period, I also began exploring the amplitude structure of the $$ D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^- $$ decay.
