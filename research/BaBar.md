# BaBar

During my doctoral studies, I was a member of the BaBar collaboration, an experiment based at SLAC, Stanford, USA. My research focused on the search for CP violation in multibody decays of charm mesons. I initially studied the decay $$ D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^- $$ [1], followed by the $$ D^+ \to K^+K_S^0\pi^+\pi^- $$ and $$ D_s^+ \to K^+K_S^0\pi^+\pi^- $$ decays [2]. I was responsible for all aspects of these analyses and developed the triple-product asymmetry technique, which—after several refinements—I continue to apply within the LHCb experiment. During this period, I also began exploring the amplitude structure of the $$ D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^- $$ decay.

I also contributed to the study of the reconstruction efficiency of the soft pion in $$ D^{*+} \to D^0\pi^+ $$ decays [3]. In this work, I analyzed the distribution of the cosine of the helicity angle of the $$ D^{*+} $$ to extract the relative reconstruction efficiency in data and simulation. The observed differences between these distributions were used to evaluate the systematic uncertainty associated with soft pion reconstruction in the BaBar experiment.
