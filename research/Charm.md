# Charm
I have been involved in the study of mesons containing Charm since the start of my research career.
Initially, I was fascinated by the search for the asymmetry between matter and antimatter (CP violation), 
and I later extended my interests to the quantum mechanical phenomenon of $$ D^0--\bar{D}^0 $$ mixing and its implications on CP violation.
