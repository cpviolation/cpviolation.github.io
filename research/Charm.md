# Charm

I have been actively involved in the study of mesons containing charm quarks since the beginning of my research career. My initial focus was on the search for **CP violation**, a fundamental asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Over time, I expanded my interests to include the **quantum mechanical phenomenon of $$ D^0-\bar{D}^0 $$ mixing** and its interplay with CP violation, which together offer a unique window into potential contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model.


## $$ D^0 $$ Oscillations and CP violation with $$ D^0 \to K^0_S h^+h^- $$ decays

I am currently working on the measurement of the mixing and CP violation parameters in the decay $$ D^0 \to K^0_S h^+h^- $$, where $$ h $$ can be either a kaon or a pion. This decay is particularly interesting because it allows us to study both mixing and CP violation in a single decay channel. 
I contributed to the development of the "bin-flip" analysis stategy [1], which is a novel approach to extract the mixing and CP violation parameters from an analysis of the data binned in the phase-space and decay time. The analysis is performed using $$ D^0 \to K^0_S π^+π^- $$ decays collected by the LHCb experiment at CERN during Run2 [2],[3].
We are currently working on the analysis of Run3 data, which will further improve the precision of the measurements.

I am currently working on the measurement of mixing and CP violation parameters in the decay $$ D^0 \to K^0_S h^+h^- $$, where $$ h $$ denotes either a kaon or a pion. This decay channel is particularly compelling, as it enables the simultaneous study of both mixing and CP violation phenomena within a single mode.

I contributed to the development of the **"bin-flip"** analysis strategy [1], a novel method for extracting mixing and CP violation parameters through a time-dependent analysis of data binned in the Dalitz phase space. This approach has been applied to $$ D^0 \to K^0_S \pi^+\pi^- $$ decays collected by the LHCb experiment at CERN during Run 2 [2, 3], yielding competitive precision on the parameters of interest. We are currently extending this analysis to Run 3 data, which will allow for improved sensitivity due to the larger dataset and upgraded detector and trigger capabilities.

In parallel, I have been awarded a grant from the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) under the **PRIN2022** program to develop an alternative analysis strategy based on **machine learning techniques** and **GPU-accelerated fitting**. This unbinned approach aims to extract the mixing and CP violation parameters directly from the full phase-space and decay-time information, thereby avoiding the information loss inherent to binned methods. We expect this new strategy to significantly enhance the precision of the measurements and provide a flexible framework for future analyses.

In addition to the work on the decay $$ D^0 \to K^0_S π^+π^- $$, I am also involved in the analysis of the related channel $$ D^0 \to K^0_S K^+K^- $$. While structurally similar, this decay features a different final state and a distinct phase-space distribution. It is particularly compelling because it allows the study of mixing and CP violation parameters in a complementary kinematic region, notably around the $$ \phi(1020) \to K^+K^- $$ resonance. This region provides enhanced sensitivity to the mixing parameter $$ y_{CP} $$.
The Run 2 analysis was paused due to challenges in modeling the detector acceptance and limitations in the available Monte Carlo simulation. However, with the introduction of the new software trigger in Run 3 at LHCb, a more accurate description of the acceptance becomes feasible. This renewed potential makes the analysis an attractive topic for Master’s and PhD thesis projects.


## Search for CP violation in multibody $$ D^0 $$ decays

Multibody hadronic decays of $$ D^0 $$ mesons provide a promising environment for the search for CP violation, owing to their rich resonant structure and relatively high branching fractions. I have extensively studied and developed the use of **triple product asymmetries** as a tool to probe CP violation in such decays. In particular, my work on the decay $$ D^0 \to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^- $$ has led to the most precise CP violation search in this channel to date [4].
