Since 2022 I am teacher for the 2nd year statistics laboratory course for the bachelor in Physics (4 ECTS). During the course, students learn to use the Python programming language to solve problems in calculus and statistics. The course is held in the computer lab, where students can practice the exercises and ask questions to the teacher. The course is held in English. The material is available on the [course website](https://unimibfisicalaboratori.github.io/UnimibFisicaLabStatPythonWebBook/intro.html).
