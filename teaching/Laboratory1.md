Since 2019 I am teacher for the 1th year physics laboratory course for the bachelor in Physics (9 ECTS). The course is held in the laboratory, where students can practice the exercises and ask questions to the teacher. Various experiments are performed, including

- the free fall of a body and the oscillations of a Kater pendulum
- the measurement of the speed of sound with an acoustic resonator
- the measurement of the gravitational constant with a Cavendish balance
- the verification of the Coulomb law with a torsion balance
- the verification of the law of perfect gases
- the measurement of the viscosity of a fluid
- the charachterisation of a damped harmonic oscillator with a forced oscillation
- the verification of Bernoulli's law with a Venturi tube
- the verification of momentum conservation in a collision
- the verification of Hooke's law with a spring
- the charachterisation of the propagation of a wave in a string
- the verification of the law of refraction with a prism
- the verification of the laws of calorimetry

The course is held in Italian. At the end of the course, students must prepare a report on the experiments carried out. To pass a written and a oral exam is required.
